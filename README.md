## Getting started

* Simply copy / paste the code from working/main_loader.js into your game's CODE window.
* Change the URL in order to point to your own repo
* Also change URL to each of your CODE file inside the file working/sub_loader.js.
 
 From now on, simply write CODE into your favorite IDE and push file to your repo. Changes will automatically be replicated online.

 * NB : if you are using Github as a repo, you MUST enable Github Pages for your repo and access your script that Github Pages URL, otherwise it will NOT work.*
